# Python_health_care_data
The HealthCARE Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing healthcare datasets to identify meaningful patterns and insights.
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, trends, and relationships between variables.

Created visualizations to represent insights clearly and support data-driven conclusions.
Used Python libraries such as:
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical operations
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

The project was completed as part of an internship program to gain hands-on experience with real-world healthcare data.
Helped improve practical skills in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving.
